            St Bernadette Clinic is the official clinic for staffs and students in the Augustine University Ilara Community.
            Our first priority is to ensure sound and stable health to all members of the community. We urge staffs and students
            alike to visit the clinic anytime they feel unwell. <br/><br/>
            
            The clinic was officially commisioned in 2019 by our Most Reverend Arch Bishop Adewale Martins. The clinic is currently the only
            clinic in the school and is tasked with ensuring the well being and health of people in the Augustine University community<br/><br/>

            To further ensure our goal, this platform has been created so staffs and students in the community can access the clinic digitally without
            a need to be present at the clinic physically. We implore you to take advantage of this platform and use it to the fullest.
