                Drinking enough water can have numerous benefits.<br/><br/>
                Surprisingly, it can boost the number of calories you burn.<br/><br/>
                Two studies note that it can increase metabolism by 24â€“30% over 1â€“1.5 hours. 
                This can amount to 96 additional calories burned if you drink 8.4 cups (2 liters) of water per day<br/><br/>
                The optimal time to drink it is before meals. One study showed that downing 2.1 cups (500 ml) of water 30 minutes
                before each meal increased weight loss by 44%

                Despite being high in fat, nuts are incredibly nutritious and healthy.<br/><br/>
                Theyâ€™re loaded with magnesium, vitamin E, fiber, and various other nutrients.<br/><br/>
                Studies demonstrate that nuts can help you lose weight and may help fight type 2 diabetes and heart disease<br/><br/>
                Additionally, your body doesnâ€™t absorb 10â€“15% of the calories in nuts. Some evidence also suggests that this food can boost metabolism<br/><br/>
                In one study, almonds were shown to increase weight loss by 62%, compared with complex carbs
